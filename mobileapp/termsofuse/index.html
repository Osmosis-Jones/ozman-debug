                            <p>Thanks for using Ed-admin! We’re glad you are here. Please read these Terms carefully before using this App operated by Ed-admin. Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
                            <p>
                                <ul>
                                   <li>You promise to only use the Services for your personal, internal, non-commercial, educational use, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren't authorized to use the Services. We can't and won't be responsible for you using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</li>
                                   <li>Our Services may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Ed-admin.</li>
                                   <li>Ed-admin has no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Ed-admin shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or services.</li>
                                   <li>f there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that Ed-admin is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Ed-admin, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.</li>
                                   <li>Ed-admin is a dynamic learning tool, so the Services will change over time. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), or without any reason, and without notice.</li>
                                   <li>Ed-admin is free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason, including your breach of these Terms. Ed-admin has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</li>

                                    <li>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission”. Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</li>
                                    <li>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Ed-admin a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on your iPhone as well as your computer) and reproduce such User Submission, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only - your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</li>
                                    <li>If you store a User Submission in your own personal Ed-admin account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a "Personal User Submission"), you grant Ed-admin the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of displaying that Personal User Submission to you and providing you the Services necessary to do so.</li>
                                    <li>If you share a User Submission only within a Limited Access Group, or otherwise in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users) (each, a "Limited Access User Submission"), then you grant Ed-admin the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Access User Submission for the sole purpose of displaying that Limited Access User Submission to other members of that Limited Access Group (or to such specified users, as applicable) and providing you the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant the other members of that Limited Access Group (or such specified users, as applicable) a license to access that Limited Access User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services. For example, if you share a worksheet (that can be completed through the Services) with students in your Limited Access Group, you grant your students the rights necessary to view that worksheet and fill it out and return it to you.</li>
                                    <li>If you share a User Submission in a public "community" or "topic" on the Services or in a manner that more than just you or your Limited Access Group can view (a "Public User Submission"), then you grant Ed-admin the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of displaying that Public User Submission to all Ed-admin users and providing you the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with Ed-admin. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</li>
                                    <li>You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, irrevocable, and worldwide, for as long as your User Submissions are stored with us. When you delete your Ed-admin account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from Ed-admin's records and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.</li>
                                    <li>Finally, you understand and agree that Ed-admin, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services, or media.</li>
                                    <li>These conditions may be revised at any time without notice.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
