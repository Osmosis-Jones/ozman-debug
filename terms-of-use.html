                            <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

That’s why we recommend our clients make full use of all of our mobile applications.
