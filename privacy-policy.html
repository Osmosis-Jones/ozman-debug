                            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">How We Share This Information</span></p>
                            <p>We share student information in accordance with our agreement with your (or your child’s) school or school district. Generally, this includes the sharing of such information inside and outside Ed-admin under certain terms. Student information will be accessed inside Ed-admin only by those who have a “need to know” to provide the Ed-admin products and services and improve them. For example, our technical and client support teams may have access to personal information when the Ed-admin products and services are implemented for your school or school district or when the software or other changes are required for support and maintenance purposes. We use vendors to help us provide the Ed-admin products and services to you (or to your child) on behalf of our school or school district customer.</p>
