                            <h1>Kampala International School transformed their school management experience with Ed-admin</h1>

                            <h2>The story of Kampala International School Uganda</h2>
                            <p class="pt-3">KISU is a warm, vibrant and truly international school located in a very beautiful and friendly country. They believe passionately in a holistic and values-based approach to education that seeks to develop the person as well as the learner. 
                            </p>

                            <div style="text-align: center;">
                                <img class="m-5" src="/assets/img/KISU/KISU2.jpg" alt="image" width="70%">
                            </div>
                            <h2 class="pt-3"> The opportunity of managing everything from one place  </h2>

                           <i>KISU : </i>
                            <p class="pb-3">
                               Previously, our administration system had been ad hoc and produced unnecessary paperwork.
                            </p>

                            <p class="pb-3">
                                We had student records in various places; for example, the Library used a system called Oliver, and admissions used a simple spreadsheet in conjunction with paper files. The sports department was in charge of ECA, and each sports director had their own system. We also used a different reporting system depending on the secondary leader. As a result, it was difficult to find information when one was looking for it because there was no system that allowed all of the information to be in one place.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Why Kampala International School Chose Ed-admin</h2>

                            <i>KISU : </i>
                            <p class="pb-3">
                                The Head of Secondary at the time recommended Ed-admin based on his experience and recommendations. When we first looked at it, we thought the user interface was simple and user-friendly, implying that users would have a shorter learning curve. Another feature we liked was that it was modular, so we could get only the modules we needed and that served our purpose, but also that it was scaleable, so if we needed more modules, we could get them. Finally, we liked that Ed-admin gave us some wiggle room in terms of making changes and configurations without having to go through the vendor first. The fact that we could customize many aspects of the system ourselves was very encouraging in helping us make the decision to choose Ed-admin. In short, Ed-admin provided us with a management system that gives us most of the schoolâ€™s needs for administration.
                                
                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                                <p>We can confidently state that we are a more efficient school as a result of using Ed-admin</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <h2 class="pt-3">The Results </h2>
                            <p class="pb-3"> For starters, Ed-admin has enabled us to organise the school and run everything from a single location. We can provide live statistics and accurate information about students and other items whenever required. Furthermore, Ed-admin has enabled us to keep our data safe for an extended period of time, allowing us as an institution to access data dating back to when we first implemented it in the school 12 years ago.
                            </br>
                            Another thing we've been able to do is planning our way up the ladder in the future. Ed-admin enables us to plan school schedules years in advance, allowing us to see where the school is going without having to wait for the school to open before populating the system with data. We can confidently state that we are a more efficient school as a result of using Ed-admin, especially with regard to our admissions process which has become more streamlined.   
                            </p>
