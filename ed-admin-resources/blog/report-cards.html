                            <p>
                                Ed-admin education management software is a time-saver, especially in the report card
                                season.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Assessment Premium module allows teachers to keep attendance and results of various
                                assignments, tests, and quizzes of each student throughout the year on a cloud-based
                                system. Gone is the time when teachers had to enter the results of each student manually
                                and calculate the overall grade. Now, Ed-admin does all the work for you. It keeps the
                                results and grades, adds them up, and generate the report card of your choice. Having
                                the information and results of every single student in one place frees you from going
                                through tones of papers to find a single grade, and closes the chance of making
                                calculation mistakes.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Cloud-based</h2>

                            <p>A cloud-based system guarantees that your information is secure, reliable, and accurate.
                                Under any circumstances, you cannot lose a piece of information. Everything is saved on
                                the system automatically, and you can have access to them from any device and any
                                browser as long as you have your login info. In addition to keeping the information safe
                                and secure, the results saved in the grade book are absolutely accurate and proof
                                against tech glitches. Data moves through Ed-admin Assessment Module. Grades saved in
                                the grade book and assessment module, flow later to the report cards, making them as
                                reliable as possible.</p>

                            <h2>Custom Report Cards</h2>

                            <p>The great thing about the Ed-admin report card is that it is highly customisable. Schools
                                can design their own report card according to different grades, classes, teachers’
                                preferences, students’ behaviour, and basically any specific need. Ed-admin makes sure
                                that the report card is exactly what you designed, and contains the information you
                                required. You can also have several types of report cards designed for different
                                purposes, such as monthly progress, narrative, or comparative reports. Ed-admin
                                Assessment Premium module fits with all curriculum structures including PYP, IB, BGCSE
                                and IGCSE.</p>

                            <p>Ed-admin also supports adding signatures, watermarks, school logo, diagrams, graphics,
                                etc.</p>

                            <p>Transcripts contain all the grades of one student’s school journey. Mostly, transcripts
                                are used for high school students who seek further education and their complete academic
                                performance is needed. With Ed-admin transcripts, you can monitor and track students'
                                grades in charts or graphs. </p>

                            <p>Report Cards contain the grades of a particular period of education. Since Ed-admin keeps
                                all the information throughout the year in a cloud, teachers never have to enter the
                                grades to get a report card. By choosing the grade, the period of time, and the
                                template, report cards are easily generated with the Ed-admin Assessment Premium Module.

                            <p>All the Ed-admin modules are linked and integrated. They access data from one database,
                                making the information highly valid and coherent. Academic modules including Student
                                Daily Attendance, Academic Management, Assessment Premium, Learning and Behaviour
                                Management have all the necessary information from each student. The information updates
                                constantly as the semester goes by. At the end of the semester, a simple click will
                                generate the report card and the job is done.</p>

                            <p>This also gives both the students and parents enough transparency to see the detailed
                                results of each course and comprehend how each course is graded, what courses are their
                                strong points, and where they need more practice.</p>
