                                <p>
                                    The school admission process is one of the most critical touchpoints between the school and the applicants. While there is a hustle and bustle going on among the applicants, students, and parents as to how to best navigate the admission process, including school ratings, timelines, admission forms and more, schools are trying their best to make the whole process smoother and frictionless.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Here we have chosen 7 interesting examples of successful schools from across the world implementing new ideas and strategies to not only acquire more students but also help applicants to make the most informed decision. 
                                </p>

                                    The New School, Kennebunk, United States

                                <p>
                                    By offering a shadow visit opportunity, New School shows how confident they are about the experience they offer to their applicants. The student visits the school for one full day and then schedules a second visit at the recommendation of the teachers and admissions team. The student will be shadowing one or two students during the day as they attend classes. Parents schedule a meeting with the admissions coordinator during the first visit. The student is formally interviewed during the second or third visit by both a teacher and a student member of the admissions team.
                                </p>

                                    There are numerous ways out there for parents and students to find the school that is just right for them. Schools of all sizes and types try to register in as many school directories as possible in order to give themselves more and more exposure. Bayview Glen went one step further and decided to not wait for parents to come to them, but actually directly contacted the parents who they believed would find their dream school in Bayview Glen. They have been active in parents' online communities to identify the parents that might like their school and reached out to them with their offers.

                                    A virtual open house is exactly what it sounds like: An open house that a school hosts remotely, virtually, via some sort of video conferencing software. The term can also apply to other types of school enrollment events, such as question and answer sessions, drop-ins, walk-ins, and more. In lieu of an in-person open house, a virtual open house gives enrollment and admissions professionals at a school the opportunity to connect with families who are actively considering the school.
                                    Dubai College made their virtual tour when the pandemic broke out and it was no longer possible to conduct in-person visits. However, the tour video turned out to be a handy and user-friendly tool for parents and applicants even after the health issues had mostly passed. They can watch the 10-minute video from the comfort of their homes to get an idea of what the school offers before actually committing their time and energy to visit the campus.

                                Using an online application process means skipping all the back and forth emailing, problems with forms, human error, manual considerations, and more. Not to mention it is more accessible to applicants, as all they need to start their admission process is a link. Using <a href="https://www.Ed-admin.com/">Ed-admin’s Online Application</a>, Midstream College has made the whole admission process automatic. They have set up their own customised forms and customized rating system that automatically handpicks the applicants that are more aligned with the school’s requirements. They can monitor the applicants, knowing instantly where they are on admission stages. The admission fee is also collected automatically using the integrated payment gateways.

Whether held in-person or online, revisit day will most likely include meeting with current students or parents, sitting in on classes or activities, and attending a few presentations or panel discussions that include students, faculty, staff, or leadership.

                                    Using a newsletter to help applicants stay current with the deadlines is not a new technique. As soon as schools started doing email campaigns, admission details have been part of their outreach. What ASU does, however, is utilizing this channel to truly engage their prospective students with the admission process.

                                    Their newsletters, apart from being rich in colours and beautiful to look upon, are also a helpful source for basically any information applicants might want to know. More than deadlines and FAQs, ASU newsletters provide tips, updates, interviews with current students from different departments. They even provide certain statistical and trend analyses in order to let their prospective students know which fields of study are popular at the moment and why.

                                    Setting up a social media account is easy and free, but the upkeep is mighty difficult. You need to put together content that can stand out to an audience who scroll past hundreds, if not more, of photos, videos, memes, and music. The American International School of Cape Town do not content themselves to just putting up a notification on their social media wall whenever it is the admission season. By creating a well-crafted video, they not only catch the attention of potential applicants or highlight their school’s perks, but also demonstrate their professionalism
