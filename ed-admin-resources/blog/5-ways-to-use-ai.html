                            <p>
                                Advancements in technology have changed the way we educate significantly. The way we are enabling teachers, students, and administrators now to perform at the level they do is possible thanks to technological breakthroughs.</p>
                            <p>
                                That is why using Artificial Intelligence in education is gaining such momentum and is deemed by many as one of the most crucial ingredients of the future of education.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this article, we are going to take a look at five different ways educational institutions can use new AI technologies. For the most part, these innovations are not some prototype or conceptualised creations concocted by experts that might become available in the market in the next twenty years or so. They are technologies that are current, tested, and very popular.                                
                            </p>

                            <h6>1. Augmented Reality (AR)</h6>
                            <h6>2. AI-Powered Adaptive Learning</h6>
                            <h6>3. Auto Quiz Generation</h6>
                            <h6>4. AI Proctor</h6>
                            <h6>5. Student Safety Alarm</h6>

                            <h2 class="mt-5">Augmented Reality (AR)</h2>

                            <p>Augmented reality modifies a real-world environment where the objects are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, such as visual, audible, etc..</p>

                            <p>
                                Augmented reality can breathe new life into the classroom, bringing extra creativity, interactivity and engagement to any subject. AR learning helps students by decreasing the time it takes to grasp complex topics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From bringing a drawn butterfly to life to helping students learn about active volcanos while they are erupting right in front of them, using AR indeed makes classrooms extremely exciting. 
                            </p>

                            <h2>AI-Powered Adaptive Learning</h2>

                            <p>
                                Adaptive Learning utilises AI-based algorithms that empower educational companies to use the data they collect to increase learner engagement and improve outcomes.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It can help your institution create a personalised learning path based on the learner’s interests and skills, Identify learning-relevant behaviours such as focus, guessing, skipping, and monitoring trends, measure the difficulty of the learning activities and assess their appropriateness.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Auto Quiz Generation</h2>

                            <p>
                                Mixing computational linguistics with the world’s most advanced AI algorithms like GPT-3 creates assessments. That is how AI-based automatic quiz generating platforms work to make things much easier for educators.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Using auto quiz generation, the authoring tool generates various kinds of assessments like Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), True/False Questions, Match the following, etc., by analysing the text given by the teachers.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Like all other areas of AI, the technology is still in a primitive state, and the result quizzes might not be the most desirable ones in the end. Despite all the shortcomings, these AI-backed platforms can save teachers considerable time by doing the more difficult portions of the process and only leave proofreading and fine-tuning to educators.
                            </p>

                            <h2>AI Proctor</h2>

                            <p>
                                One of instructors’ major beef with online assessment is the low control of the proctoring process. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                AI proctors use multiple clever ways to ensure the credibility of exams results that are simply impossible to do manually. Proctor platforms constantly monitor students’ behaviour during the exam, and backed by ever-evolving AI, they can recognise suspicious conduct and notify the teacher in real-time. Some of these alarming behaviours are opening a tab or program other than the ones necessary to take the exam, periodic facial recognition to ensure the examiner’s identity is valid, and real-time streaming of students’ screens into the teacher’s computer. Even an internet disconnection cannot hinter the AI Proctor’s mission, as it continues to gather data and send it to the instructor when the connection is back
                            </p>

                            <h2>Student Safety Alarm</h2>

                            <p> One of the most innovative ways to use AI in the educational space. </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Backed by a progressive AI system, these platforms use behaviour monitoring to detect signs that could potentially lead to suicide or possible harm to others through threats, violence, and bullying.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Although the violation of students’ privacy by such technologies is controversial, one cannot deny how effective they are in picking up minor symptoms, alarming the school authorities, and preventing incidents that might very well be catastrophic.
