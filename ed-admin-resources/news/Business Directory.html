                                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown regulations have been a huge challenge for businesses. Many have had to close their doors, leading to job losses, endangered livelihoods, and immense pressure on families. For many households now surviving on limited or no income, finding work is vital.</p>
                                <p>
                                    We want to address these needs and do what we can to help. That’s why we are rolling out our newest feature: 
                                    the Business Directory in our <a href="/products/edana-portal-apps">Edana apps</a>, connecting businesses with potential customers and job seekers with 
                                    potential employers. Our aim is to provide a useful starting point for anyone requiring services or looking for 
                                    a particular business provider from trusted and verified sources. Business Directory is entirely free and parents

                                    members and students are eligible to use it.
