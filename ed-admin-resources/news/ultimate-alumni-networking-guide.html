                            <h2>Interesting events</h2>

                                opportunities young alumni often seek. Equipped with Edana Alumni app, you can send notifications to
                                 all of your alumni to make sure everyone receives your invitations
                            </p>
                           
                            <h2>Monthly newsletters</h2>
                            <p class="pb-3">80% of alumni organizations report that “blogs, social media, and e-newsletters” have the most impact on alumni engagement.
                                 If you aren’t already compiling a monthly e-newsletter for faculty, staff, students, and alumni, you should strongly consider it. 
                                 Sending out regular communications about your institution is a crucial way to build community. 
                                 Most recent alumni regularly view emails on their phones, so an email newsletter is an easy way to connect with them no matter
                                  where they are.</p>
                            <p class="pb-3">Edana Alumni app allows you to send richly-designed newsletters to your former students.
                                 Push notification functionality ensures a high engagement rate that easily surpasses email and other similar platforms.

                            <p class="pb-3">Many times we get caught up in the monetary aspect of “Giving Back,” and forget that a 
                                person’s time is one of the most valuable resources that they can provide.
                                 Whether it’s planning a reunion or simply sharing and liking our social media posts, 
                                 any and all forms of giving should be recognized and rewarded!
                            </p>
                            <p class="pb-3">There is nothing more unsettling than making alumni feel like their 
                                importance is directly correlated with the amount they have given. Giving your alumni the sense that they are
                                 important stakeholders is crucial. It could be as simple as asking their opinion on an upcoming event or a new building project, 
                                 Their input is valuable even without a direct monetary contribution
                            </p>
                            <h2>Support alumni businesses</h2>

                            It is crucial to consider the alumni network a two-way street. Creating an environment of mutual support between the alumni
                             and the institution is the key to driving engagement and establishing a much deeper relationship

Allowing your former students to tap into your already built network of alumni would not only boost small businesses but also provide the chance for users to reconnect with their former classmates and strengthen the network even further.

You should also consider sending a general alumni engagement survey to find out how your alumni rate their experience as a student, what your graduates need from you, and how you can build long-term relationships with alumni.

                             <p class="pb-3">Creating a student-alumni mentorship program for your institution can help you build strong connections between current and former students. Students want to engage with those who came before them and find out how to succeed beyond the university. Connect students with alumni from the same major area of study, athletic program, or hometown. Help them build a network of professional connections that can offer career advice, internship opportunities, and general “real world” support.</p>

                                The educational fundraising landscape has evolved as an outcome of the coronavirus situation. Not far removed from the crisis, both alumni and educational institutions find themselves trying to catch their breath financially. In these circumstances, encouraging non-monetary donations and fundraising in-kind could provide a platform for alumni to continue their contributions without feeling pressured.

                                If any institution hopes to create a vibrant alumni network, they cannot take their alumni for granted. Only 19% of alumni report an organization’s representatives made them feel recognized. Also, 74% of donors/members appreciate some form of personal “thank you” for their gift or membership. Showing even a little bit of appreciation can go a long way.

                                Alumni networks are not all about raising money. It’s about creating a mutually supportive community. Alumni would not appreciate being considered as little more than a bag of cash. It is, thus, very surprising to see that 100% of alum surveyed viewed an email, phone call, or direct mail piece from their alma mater as an ask for money BEFORE they engaged in the communication. It is a mistake all educational institutions want to avoid when communicating with their former students.

There is no reason to think the situation would be any different with the alumni, especially the younger ones. Data shows that 34% of Millennials don’t join a program because the enrollment process is too long. If you use an enrolment process, keep it short and effective.
