                            <h1>Learning Support: Every Student is Precious</h1>

                            <p class="pb-3">
                                Vivian suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
                            </p>
                            <p class="pb-3">
                                In many ways, she seems like an ordinary 15-year-old student. And of course, every ordinary is somewhat unique, right? She is sharp, clever, and sometimes funny. She loves history, visual art, and alternative rock and plays in her school’s football team. She has just started learning the Hang and is getting better by the day. She is surrounded by a loving family and is a prominent member of a like-minded social group of teens.
                            </p>
                            <p class="pb-3">
                                But, there is a troubling side to this unique-ordinary life. Her teachers noticed she sometimes fixates on a problem for hours, unable to let go, and some days she simply can’t bring herself around to focus on anything.    
                            </p>

                            <p class="pb-3">
                                What at first seemed like a common teenage turbulence of hormones, was exacerbated over time. Teachers started chastising her for her “odd behaviour”. And even though she knows she has ADHD, the thought of explaining her condition every time to every teacher, principal, and staff in front of her schoolmates is unbearable.
                            </p>

                            <p class="pb-3">
                                There are many students like Vivian in every educational institution. And I'm not talking about people with ADHD only, but all students with severe conditions that require special care. Hearing impairment, mobility issues, chronic disorders, and more.    
                            </p>
                            <div class="article-image">

                                Here’s an infographic on the most common disabilities among students as of 2022.
                            </p>
                            <p class="pt-3">
                                How much do you care about your student's individual needs? Even if the answer is a lot, I bet it is difficult to organise things in a way that would provide the best attention to differently-abled students.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Learning Support</h1>

                            <p class="pt-3">
                                Catering to special needs is crucial in keeping students, staff and parents happy and helping them achieve their best. Ed-admin’s Learning Support module helps provide extra support over and above the curriculum.
                            </p>

                            <p class="pt-3">
                                Easily manage and record therapy sessions, assessments, day-to-day notes such as a student exhibiting signs of ADHD and even exam accommodations.
                            </p>

                            <p class="pt-3">
                                You can make sure that every examiner is notified of students' special conditions and conduct the exam accordingly.   
                            </p>
                            <p class="pt-3">
                                The multi-level security system allows for easy control over what sensitive data staff have access to.
