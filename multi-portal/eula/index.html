                                        Ed-admin initiatives are largely aimed at educational institutions, with Ed-admin Learning being our key learning management software. Soon enough, our brand new learning management software, edana, will be rolled out to the public. <br>
                                        Both of these products are backed by a versatile set of mobile applications for students, staff and parents, each encompassing a wide range of functions. <br>
                                        For those who offer educational supplies and those who are looking for supplies, we have created Edstore, an online platform that connects businesses owned by teachers, parents, and students.
